#Ruby (Very) Simple Genetic Algorithm

This is a small, 2-class string manipulator for Ruby. The outcome of this algorithm will be to evolve a desired "goal string" from a set of randomly generated strings of the same length.

The author's intention is to adapt and reuse this in a future project upon completion.
