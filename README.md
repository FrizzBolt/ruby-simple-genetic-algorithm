#Ruby (Very) Simple Genetic Algorithm

This is a small, 2-class string manipulator for Ruby. It will evolve random strings to a goal word after a few generations when run.

This will soon be adapted into a Rails database model and then integrated with a Box2Djs simulation where a different fitness test will be written. The current selection algorithm will also be replaced with a tournament selection algorithm.
